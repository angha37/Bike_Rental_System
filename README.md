# Bike_Rental_System
 Description: I have implemented a code which checks the stocks of a bikes which  is available for rent. If the bikes are available then it requests for rent with particular  rate and gives it on rent. But if the customer request of bike is more than available stock  it prints particular rejection message and exits.
